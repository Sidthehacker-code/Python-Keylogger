Sidthehacker - Python Keylogger
Welcome to my Python Keylogger project! This repository contains a simple implementation of a keylogger written in Python. It allows you to capture keypress events in real time. Please note that this tool should be used ethically and for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

📜 Project Overview
This keylogger works by capturing keystrokes from the user and storing them in a log file. The keylogger runs in the background and can be used to monitor activities for testing and security purposes. It is developed in Python and uses libraries such as pynput to listen to the keyboard.

⚙️ Features
Captures all keypresses made on the system
Logs keystrokes into a local file for further analysis
Runs in the background and can be terminated by the user
Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)
🔧 Requirements
To run the keylogger, you need Python installed on your system along with some dependencies:

Python 3.x
pynput library
Install dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
🚀 How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sidthehacker-code/python-keylogger.git
cd python-keylogger
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r keystrokes.txt
Run the keylogger:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
The keylogger will begin running and logging all keystrokes into keylog.txt.

To stop the keylogger, use CTRL + C in your terminal.

🛡️ Ethical Usage
This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Do not use it for illegal activities. Before using this keylogger on any system, ensure you have permission from the owner of the system. Unauthorized monitoring or data collection is illegal and could have serious consequences.
